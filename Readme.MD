## TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 

### Difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTP is a means of communcation that establishes a connection between the client and the server using a web browser. HTTPS is HTTP but secure, because it uses SSL to move data. SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) is an encrypted link between server and the browser that ensure the data passed between them are secure. 

### What is DNS?
Domian Name System is kind of like a phone book for the internet. It associates various information with domain names and their addresses. 

### What is the difference between a proxy and a VPN?
Both help you connect to a remote computer. Proxies hide your IP addresses by acting as a middlemen in the flow of internet traffic so you appear to be using it from a different location. For example, if you are trying to access a region restricted Youtube video, then Proxy is a good choice. They only act as a middlemen, they do not strip away your identity. 

VPN also acts as a middlemen between the computer and the server but it goes through a heavily ecrypted tunnel between the VPN Server and the computer remote network. This is ideal to use if the information, security and privacy is of high importance. 

### What is a Firewall?
It is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. It monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

### What is RAID?
It is a data storage technique which combines multiple physical hard disk drives into one for the purpose of data redundancy. 
- RAID 0 - Striping (Data is split into multiple blocks to offer superiod I/O performance.
- RAID 1 - Mirroring (Data is copied exactly to another drive in case of data backup.

### TCP vs IP?
IP is responsible for the logical addressing whereas TCP makes sure the packets are delivered successfully. 

# Internet Information Services (IIS)

### What is IIS and when is it used?
IIS is a web server that runs on the .NET platform on the Windows OS. If you want to host applications on a server that everybody can use, then IIS comes into play. It can be managed remotely with the use of CLI or PowerShell. 

### What protocols does it support?
It supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP, etc.

### What is Application Pool in IIS?
They are used to seperate different workers accessing the same IIS resources and configuration. They are used to isolate our web applications for better security, performance and to keep running without affecting each other. 

### What is the name of the Default Application Pool in IIS?
It is called DefaultAppPool.

### What is Recycling of Aplication Pool?
Recycling application pool means recycle the worker process and the memory used for web application. By default, they recycle every 29 hours. 

### What are the main layers of IIS?
Two type of layers are Kernel Mode and User Mode. 

### What uses memory in the process?
Everything on the stack and heapâ€”static variables and properties, anything in the memory cache, any objects that are referenced by another object, any blocks of memory waiting to be garbage collected.

### What is overlapped recycle?
No new requests would be handled until the current requests completed or the configurable timeout period elapsed (90 seconds by default).

### IIS CLI Commands? (Windows 2000)
- Display tasks - findweb and disptree
- Find Virtual website - findweb -c MachineName www.DomainName.com
- Display Admin Tree - disptree -a IIS://ComputerName OR disptree -a IIS://LocalHost/w3svc -n
- Create Tasks - mkw3site and mkwebdir
- Create Virtual website - Mkw3site -r RootDirectory DriveLetter:\FolderName -t NewServerName -h HostName www.MyNewWebsite.com
- Create Virtual web dir - Mkwebdir -c ComputerName -w "WebSiteName" -v DirectoryName,DriveLetter:\FolderName
- Stop a Virtual Site Without Interrupting the Entire Web Service - adsutil STOP_SERVER W3SVC/Server#
- Start a Virtual Site Without Interrupting the Entire Web Service - adsutil START_SERVER W3SVC/Server#
