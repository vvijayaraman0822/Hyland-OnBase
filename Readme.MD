## TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 

### Difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTP is a means of communcation that establishes a connection between the client and the server using a web browser. HTTPS is HTTP but secure, because it uses SSL to move data. SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) is an encrypted link between server and the browser that ensure the data passed between them are secure. 

### What is DNS?
Domian Name System is kind of like a phone book for the internet. It associates various information with domain names and their addresses. 

### What is the difference between a proxy and a VPN?
Both help you connect to a remote computer. Proxies hide your IP addresses by acting as a middlemen in the flow of internet traffic so you appear to be using it from a different location. For example, if you are trying to access a region restricted Youtube video, then Proxy is a good choice. They only act as a middlemen, they do not strip away your identity. 

VPN also acts as a middlemen between the computer and the server but it goes through a heavily ecrypted tunnel between the VPN Server and the computer remote network. This is ideal to use if the information, security and privacy is of high importance. 

### What is a Firewall?
It is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. It monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

### What is RAID?
It is a data storage technique which combines multiple physical hard disk drives into one for the purpose of data redundancy. 
- RAID 0 - Striping (Data is split into multiple blocks to offer superiod I/O performance.
- RAID 1 - Mirroring (Data is copied exactly to another drive in case of data backup.

### TCP vs IP?
IP is responsible for the logical addressing whereas TCP makes sure the packets are delivered successfully.
